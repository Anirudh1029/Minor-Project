Title: **HYBRID ACCESS CONTROL USING RBAC AND ABAC**\
“Hybrid Access Control Model” is proposed to address the issues related to access control on an organization’s resources.\
It has integrated both the properties of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) And Role Based Access Control (RBAC).\
RBAC: Dictates organization roles and their access permissions \
ABAC: Dictates attributes of the user who is requesting access. \
According to the user roles, what tasks they are responsible for inside the company can be determined, and according to user factors like time and location, it can be determined if they are accessing them from home or the office. \
It also uses two-factor authentication to create an additional layer of security to verify the identity and attributes of users before granting access.
