Title:
HYBRID ACCESS CONTROL USING RBAC AND ABAC
“Hybrid Access Control Model” is proposed to address the issues related to access control on an organization’s resources.
It has integrated both the properties of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) And Role Based Access Control (RBAC).
RBAC: 
Dictates organization roles and their access permissions 
ABAC:
Dictates attributes of the user who is requesting access. 
According to user roles, it can be determined what tasks they are responsible for inside the company, and according to user factors like time and location,
it can be determined if they are accessing from home or the office. 
It is also using Two-factor authentication to create an additional layer of security to verify the identity and attributes of users before granting access.
